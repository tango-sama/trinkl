# Progress Tracker

Update this file whenever the current phase, active feature, or implementation state changes. It must reflect the actual, deployed state of desert-shop-24af9.web.app — not the intended state (see `development-workflow.md`).

## Current Phase

- Live in production — maintenance and incremental features.

## Current Goal

- Nothing active. Next candidate: port the security lockdown to the Bazar Merabet clone (see Next Up).

## Completed

- Storefront: home, products, product detail, categories, collagen landing page, checkout — RTL Arabic, Blush Rose & Gold theme.
- Cart in localStorage; orders created in Firestore at checkout; optional WhatsApp order confirmation.
- Admin panel (`amelhadj.html`): products, categories, featured, orders, messages, income/expenses ledger, settings.
- Delivery carriers: Yalidine, Noest, ZR Express — idempotent parcel creation, tracking lookup, synced fee grids (`delivery_fees` / `delivery_data`), per-carrier enable toggles.
- Admin notifications: web push (`push_subs` + `push-sw.js`) and Gmail email on new orders/messages.
- Security lockdown (2026-07-19): admin panel gated by Firebase Auth email/password; `firestore.rules` tightened — catalog public-read/admin-write, orders & messages create-only for clients, customer data and expenses admin-only.
- WhatsApp site-wide toggle (2026-07-19): `site_settings.waEnabled` + admin Settings button; hides every WA surface via `html.no-wa` and guards JS openers.
- Context docs (2026-07-19): `CLAUDE.md` + `context/` folder; internal files excluded from Hosting (were publicly downloadable).

## In Progress

- None yet.

## Next Up

- Port the security lockdown (auth gate + tightened rules) to Bazar Merabet (`mrabet-fb38c`) — its rules are still wide open, exposing its customer orders.
- Port the WhatsApp toggle to Bazar Merabet in the same pass.
- Commit the four untracked product images in `assets/collagen/` (referenced by the live site).

## Open Questions

- None. Add one here instead of guessing when a requirement is missing.

## Architecture Decisions

- Static site, no framework, no build step — files deploy as-is to Firebase Hosting.
- Firestore schema is append-only: new code tolerates old document shapes; no migrations.
- Single-admin auth: Firebase Auth email/password, `isAdmin()` in rules checks the exact admin email; customers stay anonymous.
- Carrier credentials live only in server-only `private/*` docs, read by Cloud Functions via Admin SDK.
- Parcel creation is idempotent per order per carrier — safe to re-run.
- `sw.js` is a permanent kill-switch: the site must never register a caching service worker again.
- Branding stays in theme tokens and the `SITE` config so the Bazar Merabet clone can rebase cleanly.

## Session Notes

- 2026-07-19: Security lockdown designed, deployed, and REST-verified (catalog 200, customer data 403, order create 200). Admin password is set in the Firebase console and known only to the owner — sign in once per device at `/amelhadj`. WhatsApp toggle added and deployed (default: enabled). Deploys run from this machine with the Firebase CLI (`firebase deploy --only hosting|firestore:rules|functions`).
- A test order named "TEST - rules check (delete me)" was created during rules verification — owner should delete it from the admin panel if not done yet.
